      <description>&lt;p&gt;Incessantly, the voice speaks, confused stuff, without connection. Suddenly, it shoots up from the depths of the subconscious, this mysterious supercomputer that eludes my direct control: an idea. Ideas are invigorating, they feel exciting. Within them slumbers a potential - something valuable that I (and only I) can realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas are fleeting; they remain in memory only for a moment, in the working memory of the brain. This is where it&amp;rsquo;s decided whether I forget the idea in a moment of carelessness, follow it with blind activism, or first examine it more closely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In between your meetings you answer messages or emails from the various communication tools you use. If you are lucky you‘ll end up with a small oasis of time that you can use to get your „real work“ done. The more responsibility you accumulate at your place of work - for people or projects - the more time you spend with randomly distributed acts of communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
