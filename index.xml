      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a knowledge worker, you know the struggle: Each day is a series of meetings, which seem to be randomly distributed throughout your calendar. In between your meetings you answer messages or emails from the various communication tools you use. If you are lucky you‘ll end up with a small oasis of time that you can use to get your „real work“ done. The more responsibility you accumulate at your place of work - for people or projects - the more time you spend with randomly distributed acts of communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do what you love.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2006, just a few months after I finished school, Paul Graham wrote an essay titled &amp;ldquo;How to Do What You Love&amp;rdquo;. It would have been perfect timing if I had read that essay at that time, but this is not how this story goes. I studied computer science, became a tech journalist for a few years, learned many things about marketing technology in a web agency, and ended up building a martech solution for more than a decade. And then I read that essay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
